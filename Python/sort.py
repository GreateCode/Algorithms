	See:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort
	Time Complexity: O(n*n)
	Stable: Yes
	Description:
		The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. 
	Optimized:
		The above function always runs O(n^2) time even if the array is sorted.
		So,if the inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap then we can stop it~how do ?
		Here are the code.
